comments: As it turns out, scrying before you draw is pretty good. The best use of the flashback cost is to exile this to your hand with a Gloomhaven character or two in hand and have a guaranteed turn-one Thrashing Bramble draw two. You can also do this with a Fable deck that's missing its fabled creatures, which I guess are kind of like Gloomhaven characters.
comments: I actually do think Deeproot Waterfall is strong enough without the additional flashback cost, and that part mostly just adds to the hilarity of playing a game where you're trying to flashback a card you already drew

- @Jammin2450 I think you meant "only once each turn". Otherwise it's insane. If you mean only once in total, it's very weak and doesn't really fit the character of Wally West at all. Plus, it costs more than most 3-drops, which is another issue.
- I see what you did there. Clever and fitting!
- This is definitely the best option, especially since it actually lets you use him as a commander now.
- @PinkDragon6 I was thinking the same thing. It just makes no sense for Wally to be able to do that twice every turn. That's way too much. But he could totally come back twice every turn to

TDMeta.com notes: As the name suggests, this is meant for a deck full of Human Soldiers, but you can use it on any creature if it's powerful enough. At 5 mana, it's pretty steep as an immediate-speed effect, but when you want to put the hurt on somebody, there are few better ways to do it.

comments: Worth mentioning that this is not a cantrip. You don't draw a card for casting this, only for choosing the second or third mode. It is similar to Lightning Bolt in that it has several modes for one spell with different numbers of targets. Except the first mode doesn't have a limit on its number of targets (it could hit all creatures in play). Also, note that it can be used for card advantage when there are more than 8 creatures in play.

 suggestion: With an artifact and two land cards in hand, play Dragon’s Hoard, a legendary Dragon artifact that draws cards when you play Dragons. Partner it with Red Dragon, Shou Zi. Then spend your mana on Dragons. It becomes one of the most fun decks to pilot, while also being pretty competetive. The deck is also quite flexible—you could even go more budget and use a Dragon from Magic 2014 or Magic 2015, as they only cost one colorless mana each.

 opin: I love the idea of a token-fueled "Sunbreaker" card! Not only do we have the iconic Sunbreaker Aura from the game's debut (which I can see being reprinted on this guy), but it also gives us another double striker in a deck like Aggro, which is always fun to play with. The only concern I had was if this card would feel too good without some kind of drawback (like a static tax on token creation, perhaps). But then I realized you can just make token-making artifacts or something.

friedrich_miescher: This could go on a lot of commanders, but I imagine it being the most powerful on someone who is already a tank and has some ramp (or at least can draw cards). It's also possible that you don't want to destroy another creature since they might be able to remove it from combat. So if that's what your commander does, this spell isn't really ideal for them. But I'd try it out with someone like Rath or Oros anyway.

 opinion: I really like the idea of this card. The fact that he can't be blocked is pretty funny. But the abilities are weird, in my opinion. Sure, giving a creature +2/+0 at the beginning of combat is good, but only if there is an actual attacker. And creating a token with defender is interesting, but doesn't interact well with his ability to not be blocked, so you have to attack with him, even when you don't want to. I'm not sure how to make him better, though, since the flavor is pretty cool. Maybe give him flash? Or some

 opinion: I like this card a lot. While it doesn't see a ton of play, it does make an appearance in some decks, most notably the ones that run A-Luna Ring. You can go all in on one attacker with this card or save your best guys for when they really count. Either way you can get great results out of it, as long as you don't mind losing the creature after all that.</s><s> tavern brawl

ಠ_ಠ: This is a little weird. You can regenerate Dr. Octopus twice for the price of tapping any two other creatures, but those don't have to be on the battlefield. That makes this guy not much better than a cheap villain with regeneration...except when it comes time to pay for that second regeneration! At that point you have the choice of spending your second regeneration or just paying life equal to Dr. Octopus's toughness. But there's also the third possibility: pay 4 life and sacrifice him. I like that, as it's always an interesting dilemma.

 opinion: This card isn't as good as it looks at first glance. Sure, you get to pump your guy and give him trample. But he's also going to be stunned the next time he becomes tapped! That means he doesn't untap during his controller's next untap step. Which means you can't attack unless you have enough untappers for your team to keep the board full enough to avoid another round of stun counters. At best, this card will help you deal extra damage one time. The rest of the game will probably just go like normal.

 opinions: This one has interesting flavor and good synergy with the mechanic introduced in the Spider-Man games. There are so many ways to make your opponent lose life that it's almost always worth attacking even if you're going to get killed. But even if you never attack, drawing cards off the extra damage is pretty good too. I'd rate him an 8/10, but I only like him because he's from the Spider-Man games.

 suggester: Caleb James @ CJPlaytest
 suggestions: While the tentacle ability is a pretty simple effect on paper, there are a number of ways to exploit it in order to gain advantages against an opponent. The obvious one is attacking with creatures that don't untap, but if you can keep your non-untapping creatures on the board for multiple turns, they can do all sorts of things such as block every attack and attack through chump blocks without having to worry about being untapped at the end of their controller's untap step. Another possible use is to play a creature like Sutured Thrinax or Blisterstick Shaman and have it constantly untap and thus attack every turn. Of course, this will also leave your opponents with only a single blocker each combat, so they may still be

- Shimmering Creek is basically just a Borderland with a cycling ability tacked on. It's only notable as one of the few common lands that enters untapped.
- I like this card because I have a hard time getting around the cycling cost (mostly because I don't like to discard cards). I think this is a decent card in any green deck. If you could discard at instant speed, it might even be great.
- This isn't the best card in the world, but it has the advantage of coming into play untapped and it cycles. Cycling lets you search for a land and tap it without putting it into your hand or paying mana to cast it. That's useful if you need a land to block or activate an ability on an artifact or creature.
- Shimmering Creek is a Borderland that can cycle for one green mana. It's

@Trapster. I'm not quite sure how to play it yet, but you could start out with just a token that says "Whenever you cast a spell, if it has flashback, you may pay {R}. If you do, exile it. At the beginning of your end step, if there are three or more cards in your graveyard that have flashback, you win the game." The thing is, you can just play it like a regular deck by putting all the spells you want on the stack and waiting until you cast the last one before sacrificing the token.

 opinion: This was spoiled in a Commander 2019 deck (Syr Aurelia). As usual, these cards are much stronger in commander than they are in standard. But even in a multiplayer EDH game, this would be too slow to really do anything meaningful by the time it finishes. If you're playing Syr Aurelia, this might be better than a lot of other three-card combos since it does things over multiple turns rather than all at once.

comment: If this is on the battlefield, you can choose one of the exiled cards to be a part of the spell you cast. For example, if you cast a blue instant like Arcane Denial from your hand, it could target a red permanent rather than a blue one. If you cast a white enchantment with flashback, you could pay its alternate cost rather than its mana cost.

 opinio: I really liked this mechanic when I tried it out with friends, and it seemed to work nicely. However, I didn't know how to make the effect fit into a Commander deck, so I just made an enchantment that does it. It may not be very fun in real games. Also, since this card doesn't say otherwise, you can still play lands and cast spells on your own turn if you want to.
